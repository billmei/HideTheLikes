# Hide Facebook Post Likes

Hides the number of likes received on Facebook posts so you can stop comparing yourself to everyone else.

Facebook is not a popularity contest. When you share something, share it because you care about your friends, and not because you just want to have the most number of likes on your post. Hiding the likes and shares on posts, comments, and news feed items lets you have a meaningful conversation instead.
